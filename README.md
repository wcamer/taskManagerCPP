# Overview
This is a program written in C++ as a demonstration of syntax and concepts learned.  Additionally, there is information that is useful for newcomers to C++.   

# Purpose
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the concepts that I learned in researching, practicing and writing in C++.  Additionally, C++ is a language that I felt would be a challenge in learning but, what I found out was that C++ is similar to other languages in its learning.  What I mean by that is that there are aspects that are unique to this language, such as object manipulation through referencing, but that is to be espected because otherwise "C++" as a language would redundant.  The important lesson I relearned is the value of asking questions to help point your research.  If you keep asking questions when confronted with challenges then you have a something that will point you to the direction of the asnwer with the vast infomration that exists.

# Program Desciption
This program is a task manager that give the ability to the user to create tasks, give the task a name, and give a description to the task.  The program will keep track of the tasks given in order and when the time comes to notify the program a task is completed, the program will move the task to the completed list and reorder the task list.  In the program there is creation/declaration and manipulation of variables and classes/objects.  Additionally, there are functions, conditionals and loops.  Something important to point out is "referencing" of objects in order for objects to be appropriately manipulated.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Something to fix in the future, finish input validation through out the program.
- Something to improve in the future, options to include a remove task option that doesn't automatically complete the task.
- Something to add in the future, add a "save for later" option.
